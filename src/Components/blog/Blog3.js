            <div className="body">
                <p><b>Android software development</b> is the process by which applications are created for devices running the Android operating system.
            </p>
            To start with Android Development you must be aware of Prerequisites for Android Development. First of all you must decide the <b>language</b> which will you use in development and XML(Syntax). For languages we have two choices.
            <br />
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>Java</b>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Kotlin</b>(Official Language)
                </li>
                </ol>

                <p>You have to decide first which one you want to do. If I elaborate them <b>Kotlin</b> is now an <b>official language</b> for Android Development. Then which Language to choose for Kotlin or Java? It’s answer is simply if you know java little
                bit you can start with java but if you are fresh and want to do only android development then you can go for Kotlin. Basically they are same difference is somewhat in syntax. But keep in mind that if you start with Java you will have more
                option to do with it like you can make different applications from it, Game Development, etc.</p>

                <p>If you are confused which to choose then go for JAVA further in future if you want to switch to Kotlin you can do so it will easy for you to do so.</p>

                <br />
                <p>So, know <b>How much we have to do in Java or Kotlin??</b></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        You have to learn basics of Language like Syntax, Function, Arrays, ArrayList, List, etc.
                </li>
                    <li>
                        You must know about OOP’s (Object oriented Programing Structure) basics of OOP’s, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Inheritance, etc.
                </li>
                    <li>
                        (OPTIONAL) If you want you can go for DSA (Data Structure and Algorithm) also this is up to you if you want to do or not.
                </li>
                </ol>

                <br />
                <p> The above mentioned points(1, 2) will take approx. 1 month or may be less if you do with full dedication. <b>DSA may take long for you you can skip this step in early stages.</b></p>

                <p>With Language (JAVA or KOTLIN) you must know about <b>XML(Extensible Markup Language) int this you need to know about syntax only.</b></p>

                <p>After doing prerequisites know its time to move on major part.</p>

                <br />
                <p>You can start with any <b>online course</b> (For paid &rarr; Udemy, etc. , For Free&rarr; MOOC’s program of COURSERA, EDX, UDACITY, etc..) or you can do it from YouTube.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        First of all go for Basic Syntax and make apps with <b>Single Page</b> without input given by user then go for making apps with user input.
                </li>
                    <li>
                        Then go for multiple pages app by the help of <b>Intents</b> and all.
                </li>
                    <li>
                        Then slowly slowly increase your knowledge with the help of using Listeners, Handlers.
                </li>
                    <li>
                        Then make apps which uses List and then go for <b>Recycler View</b> and way how you can optimize your app.
                </li>
                    <li>
                        Then go for <b>Parsing JSON</b>(JavaScript Object Notation) file to extract data from it. Then move on with <b>Database SQLite</b>.
                </li>
                    <li>
                        Make beautiful apps and then can go for <b>Fragments</b>, etc. You can add <b>Menu</b> to your app.
                </li>
                </ol>

                <br />

                <p>You can prefer Official <b>Android Development</b> documentation by <b>Google Developers</b> for more.</p>

                <p> At starting it will may feel <b>confusing</b> in reading documentation but slowly you will understand. You can go to <b>Stack Overflow</b> for getting answers of your question fast. You can also see previous questions.</p>
